### üí¨ Comments

- Arbitrarily added close button for the mini cart‚Äî corridor tests showed users didn‚Äôt know how to close it
- Gallery modal not implemented.
- Left product image size between screen widths 500px - 768px as it is (too big).
  Usually designers decide if it's ok or no.
- Issue with SVG icons that are not created in common grid system and some not being aligned properly.
- Layout hasn't been tested on screens wider than 1440px
- Cart logic is for demonstration purposes only and doesn't reflect real-world logic.
  Quantity gets updated only on first item in cart.
- Currently mini cart dialog does not recalculate its positioning when open and screen size is changed.
- Left all focus rings as-is- design/ux decision.
- Never used Web Components before so be gentle

Tested on latest versions of MacOs Safari, Chrome, Firefox and iOS Safari.
